# RealTimeBusTracker
In this exercise we used Mapbox and MBTA bus data to animate a tracker that would display a bus along it route from MIT to Harvard. To allow the code to pull data from these two sources we needed to work with access tokens to prove we are an authorized source. The tracker would update every second using a loop, and if the bus moved it would update the marker to next bus stop.

To use this program you would simply load the page and then press the button to show you the stops inbetween MIT and Harvard; aswell as the location of the bus.

For future implications we could design this to update over multiple different areas, not only use one kind of public transportation and possibly add toll cost data.
